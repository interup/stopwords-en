# Stop words (En) Backups

## About

This directory will contains all backups of previous verisons of stopwords-en.json.

## Notes

All archived stopwords-en.json will be saved in a directory named the date the stopwords-en.json file was last updated. For example, in the "10-09-2016" directory contains a "stopwords-en.json" file. This means that "stopwords-en.json" file was last updated on October 09, 2016.

The "10-09-2016" was the original "stopwords-en.json" file made by genediazjr which can be viewed here: https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-en/commits/master. The file was last updated in 2016, so it's pretty old and outdated.
